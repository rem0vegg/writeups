I participated in this CTF as part of the team [TCP1P](https://tcp1p.team/).

During the competition, I worked on four challenges across the Forensic, Misc, and OSINT categories.

At the end of the event, our team ranked #22 out of 863 teams. Personally, I contributed 534 points, making me Rank #4 in the team out of 25 players.
